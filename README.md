# Scheduler-Calendar

## Description
The Calendar Application is a browser-based tool powered by jQuery that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. It features a visually appealing interface with a grid layout displaying hours from morning to evening. Users can easily add event details by clicking on an hour and typing in the information. The application dynamically updates HTML and CSS to reflect changes and provides visual cues for current, past, and future hours. By working on this project, I gained experience in jQuery, javaScript,  manipulation, event handling, and responsive design principles.
